# WDB Application Portal

Welcome to the WDB Application Portal demo repository! Our goal with this project was to create an application portal that would automatically save student applications and allow students to conveniently apply to multiple different Berkeley clubs on the same website. This app was built with [Convex](https://convex.dev) and showcases some of the platform's most valuable functionality, including real-time data sync and easy to use backend logic.

There's a live version of the site at https://convex-application-portal.vercel.app! This version has checks for admin access disabled so anyone can access the admin portal. See [here](https://github.com/web-at-berkeley/application-portal/blob/53b801e6153a7e43fc17c57a51fbf4b8fc1dce14/convex/common.ts#L38) for instructions on how to re-enable the proper security logic for a real-world app.

Here's a quick clip of the real-time sync in action:
